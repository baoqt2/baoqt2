Classification of various distracted driver poses using CNNs such as VGG16 and Mobilenet models.

Distracted Driving:

The impact from a vehicular accident is enormous, yet totally preventable. To avoid these types of tragedies we wish to develop an autonomous detector that can predict whether or not a driver is distracted through the use of dash cams. 

Datasets: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data

Training data: Contains 22,424 images in the training data separated into 10 labeled class folders.
Testing data: 79.7 thousand unlabeled images (tested for accuracy through kaggle submission).
Size of each image given to us is 640 Ã— 480 pixels.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of what we did and our report too:
